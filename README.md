# Generative-AI-for-synthesising-medical-images-of-tumours
The aim of this project is to develop and evaluate generative models that will enable the generation of images of lungs with tumours that are similar to real images in the assessment of doctors.


Research Project – Master’s Studies, Gdańsk University of Technology

🎯 Project Goal

In thoracic imaging, one of the major challenges is the limited availability of diverse datasets containing pulmonary tumors. Machine learning systems for medical image analysis require large and well-balanced datasets, especially for rare or small lesions, which are often underrepresented.

The goal of this project is to develop a generative AI system capable of producing realistic, anatomically consistent CT images of lungs with synthetic tumors. The solution aims to support research, data augmentation, and development of diagnostic algorithms by creating controlled, parameterized examples of pathological findings.

This project was carried out as part of the Research Project course (Master’s studies) at the Gdańsk University of Technology.

🧪 Scope of Work

The project includes:

- generation of healthy lung CT images,

- controlled synthesis of lung images with tumors using parameterized inputs (location, size, side of the lung),

- creation of synthetic datasets for training, testing, or benchmarking medical AI models,

- preliminary evaluation of realism and technical quality of generated samples.
